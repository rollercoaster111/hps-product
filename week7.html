		<h2>Summary of Week 7</h2>
		<p>
			For Week 7 of the HPS program, the participants learned about how a Bill of Materials (BOM) is created and the purposes of it are highlighted. It became apparent that the teams which reference the BOM for product information rely on it heavily for accurate information about price and availability. Another part of the design process which was brought up was the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which, in fundamental terms, is a set of instructions on how to assemble the consumer electronic products. In essence, most of the SOP was composed of pictures showing incremental stages of assembly. Along with these two design process steps, HPS participants were also advised to make yet another revision to the parts based upon the quote given by Protolabs.
