		<h2>Summary of Week 5</h2>
		<p>
			For Week 5 of the HPS program, the participants were introduced to Design for Manufacturing (DFM) principles which would affect their productâ€™s design. Of course, since the main manufacturing method was injection molding, many topics were brought up, such as ribs and gussets for support along with draft angles to aid in the removal of formed parts from machines. These new concepts led to more revisions of the parts created, and another version of the consumer electronic product was meant to be turned in by the end of the week. The production design process (PDP) was also introduced, and the introduction was included to give the HPS participants an idea of the scope of a typical consumer electronic product, as well as what to consider when redesigning the assembled components.
