		<h2>Week 5 Summary</h2>
		<p>
			For Week 5 of the HPS program, the participants were introduced to Design for Manufacturing (DFM) principles which would affect their product's design. Of course, since the main manufacturing method was injection molding, many topics were brought up, such as ribs and gussets for support along with draft angles to aid in the removal of formed parts from machines. These new concepts led to more revisions of the parts created, and another version of the consumer electronic product was meant to be turned in by the end of the week. The production design process (PDP) was also introduced, and the introduction was included to give the HPS participants an idea of the scope of a typical consumer electronic product, as well as what to consider when redesigning the assembled components.
		</p>

		<h3>Revised Design (v2)</h3>
		<p>From the last revision of the noisemaker, I made adjustments to nearly every part in some way. For the upper case, I added more ribs and gussets to support the four holes which would be in the top. For the front cover, I added a way for the screw to be inserted from the front of the product (which for some reason didn't exist in v1, oops). Ribs and two bosses were added to the back cover, and the gap for the circuit cover was increased due to the realization that more space was needed for the printed circuit boards. Finally, ribs were removed from the rear box on the bottom case, and this was for the purpose of decreasing complexity. Rounds were also added to the feet of the bottom case to increase the manufacturability.</p>
