		<h2>Summary of Week 2</h2>
		<p>
			For Week 2 in the HPS program, the participants were asked to do a product teardown of a product containing injection molded parts. The goal of this teardown was to observe the plastic injection molding features present within the parts and the product as well. Features such as consistent wall thickness, smooth edges, and more were associated with signs of possible injection molding. A concept development sketch was created for the selected product idea of the ten mentioned before, with a rough idea of where the AIY project kit parts would be within their selected design. This can be considered the first concept sketch of what may be the initial CAD design. Finally, a Product Requirements Document (PRD) was produced for the selected product idea. The PRD outlines some basic functions of the product, mentioning the design considerations that will need to be addressed to ensure the product's features are present.
