		<h2>Week 6 Summary</h2>
		<p>
			For Week 6 of the HPS program, the participants learned more about DFM principles relating to varying features along injection molded parts and how the thickness must remain consistent along the part. One important point which was made was to avoid having undercuts in the CAD design, since the presence of these details would make injection molding very difficult if not impossible. Differences in plastic solidifying throughout the formation of be part were made apparent with the idea of keeping in mind the injection molding aspects. Our deliverable includes another revised design and a quote from Protolabs which is meant to be the semi-final check of our product's manufacturability.

		<h3>Revised Design (v3)</h3>
		<p>The main thing which changed from v2 to v3 was the presence of draft angles. When my product advisor Dante Gutierrez reminded me that draft angles should be on all sides of the product, I went to work making sure these angles were up to par with the material I was using. For the noisemaker, I decided to work with ABS Plastic, which requires a 1-degree to 1.5-degree angle draft. The fix was easier than I thought with the software I was using, and the edited parts are shown below.</p>
