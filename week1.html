		<h2>Week 1 Summary</h2>
		<br>
		<p>For the first week of the HPS program, the product development process (PDP) was introduced, and this included seven components. The first part of the process was ideation, which involved brainstorming different ideas to address the problem and the different factors which may influence the solution (such as the part limitation and the manufacturing process). The next part was to make a prototype, and this prototype would be useful for gaining insight to the potential for the idea you came up with, or it may give you a reason to rethink your design. The next step in the product development process is validation, which involves further testing with your product and considering how certain objectives were achieved and failure analysis. While validation may only be represented by one step, it can take a very long time for the process of validation to be completed. The next three steps of the PDP are mass production, sustaining, and end of life, which include scaling your product and operations, observing for consistent product functionality, and the discarding of the product respectively. While these last few steps were rushed through, it is important to note that the program mainly focuses on the first three to four steps due to the length of the program.</p>

    	<h1>Ideation Sketches</h1>
    	<p>The deliverables requested during the first week of the program involved brainstorming at least ten different ideas with problem statements. Below are my ten ideas for the parts included in the AIY kit. Of course, some of these ideas are not new, but the overall objective was to look at problems and see how the AIY project parts could be utilized to solve different problems.</p>
