		<h2>Summary of Week 1</h2>
		<br>
		<p>For the first week of the HPS program involved brainstorming at least ten different ideas with problem statements. Below are my ten ideas for the parts included in the AIY kit. Of course, some of these ideas are not new, but the overall objective was to look at problems and see how the AIY project parts could be utilized to solve different problems.</p>
