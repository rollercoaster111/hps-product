		<h2>Summary of Week 3</h2>
		<p>
			For Week 3 of the HPS program, the assignment was to create a CAD model of the chosen product. The first version is meant to include at least a few of the plastic injection molding characteristics, so as to increase the ease of which more manufacturing constraints can be introduced. For each component made, features where the AIY Parts would be incorporated into the product were supposed to be highlighted, as well as potential improvements that could be made. Product Advisors for each HPS Team are encouraged to give the HPS participants additional feedback on specific changes that can aid in the productâ€™s manufacturability regarding plastic injection molding.

		<h3>Week 3 Deliverables</h3>
		<p>This week should at the very least show images of each of the v0 parts. Include an assembly if you want, but we both know that is just extra time on designing something useless.</p>
